# Schemer

Constructing a SQL database requires both an intimate knowledge of the SQL domain specific language and a pre-planned Schema.

Schemer is a database design tool that allows for database design and generation on the fly. The visual interface is interactive, and lets you setup tables, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships by simply dragging and dropping within the Schemer editor.

Schemer is built with a Vue frontend, an Express/Node backend, and MongoDB. (Dubbed by us as the **VENM** stack)
